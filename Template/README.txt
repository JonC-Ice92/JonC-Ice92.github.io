Every thing is set up in the index.html

This website is based off of the basic Bootstrap lay out with Hub bar.

I included all of the css and js i used to make the sight in the Template folder, so hopefully you copyed the whole thing.

template.css is the place where you can mess with the buttons.

If all else fales w3schools.com to the rescue. 

Enjoy!
